Project Description :

AI-Powered Chat Application  
Technologies Used: Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, PostgreSQL, Java, REST API, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Axios  

Developed an AI-powered chat application with a dynamic, user-friendly interface and real-time AI-generated responses. The project mimics ChatGPT-like functionality, enabling interactive conversations between users and an AI model. Key features include:  

- Interactive Chat Interface: Designed a responsive web interface using Thymeleaf and Bootstrap, allowing users to input prompts and view responses dynamically.  
- "New Chat" Functionality: Implemented session management to enable users to start fresh conversations without preserving previous history.  
- Real-Time AI Responses: Integrated a Spring Boot backend with custom endpoints (`/ai/generate`) to handle user prompts and return AI-generated responses via REST APIs.  
- Dynamic Chat History: Built a feature to display user prompts and AI responses incrementally, styled as separate chat cards for improved readability.  
- Backend Development: Leveraged Spring Boot for RESTful services, robust exception handling, and seamless integration with the AI model for message generation.  
- Database Integration: Configured PostgreSQL to store and manage user sessions, prompt logs, and AI responses for enhanced functionality.  
- Frontend Integration: Utilized JavaScript (with Axios) for asynchronous API calls, ensuring smooth interactions without page reloads.  
- Error Handling: Developed custom exception handling on both the backend and frontend to provide users with clear feedback during errors.  

This project demonstrates strong skills in full-stack development, REST API integration, and user-centric design, providing an intuitive and engaging AI chat experience.
